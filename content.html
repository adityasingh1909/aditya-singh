                            creepy:</p>
                        <p>“Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that
                            noise.
                            It kind of
                            sounded
                            like a puppy,
                            and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit.
                            I
                            didn’t see a
                            puppy,
                            and
                            then Mommy
                            yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before,
                            and it
                            made me sad
                            and
                            I
                            cried. Then
                            Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That
                            made me
                            feel better,
                            so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or
                            why he
                            had no hands
                            or
                            feet.”</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    <p>this one from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/"
                            style="color:rgb(255, 72, 0) ;">Reddit</a>
                        will raise your hair:</p>
                    <p> I was 8 or 9 year old when this happened. Every night around 2am I used to hear a
                        hammering
                        sound coming
                        from
                        the first floor. For context I live in a house which have three floors with a roof and
                        the
                        hammering
                        sounds
                        always
                        came from the first floor, I always thought my uncle (my father's brother) may be doing
                        something,
                        because
                        he always complained about how he couldn't sleep at night. I thought he might have found
                        a new
                        hobby or
                        something, but
                        no one else ever complained about that noise or even mentioned it. Anyways My bedroom
                        was on
                        third floor
                        and
                        it had
                        a balcony with a wooden door. One night my father was out of city for some work and all
                        of my
                        other
                        family
                        members
                        were asleep so I decided to stay up all night and watch TV, but I feel asleep. I woke up
                        to a
                        loud
                        banging
                        sound
                        coming from the balcony door, I immediately got up and asked in a voice that I am not
                        scared
                        "who is
                        outside" and
                        the banging got louder. I screamed very loudly and my mom came up to my and asked why I
                        was
                        screaming? I
                        was
                        crying
                        so she hugged me and asked again, as I was trying to tell her about what have happened,
                        the
                        banging on
                        the
                        door
                        started again and it was so brutal this time that I thought it might broke that door. My
                        mother
                        called
                        my
                        father's
                        friend who was a police officer and informed my father as well. After my father's friend
                        came,
                        he
                        checked
                        the
                        balcony and there was nothing there, he even asked us to check it with him so we
                        wouldn't be
                        afraid of
                        our
                        own
                        house. After that nothing like that ever happened again and the hammering sound well
                        never heard
                        that
                        again
                        too.
                        I never asked my family about that hammering sound because I am still afraid that I was
                        the only
                        one
                        that
                        was
                        hearing it.</p>

                        style="color:rgb(255, 72, 0) ; text-decoration:underline ; ">Reddit</a>,
                    this
                    one's gonna baffle you brains:</p>
                <p>When my daughter was born I would be the one to primarily put her to bed in her crib at night, I
                    would
                    rock
                    her back and forth in an old chair in the corner of the room. One night while I was rocking her to
                    sleep,
                    she perked up and started waving at the wall in the room, it was weird but children do weird things
                    so
                    I brushed it off. She would do weird things like this every other night. However the creepest moment
                    was
                    one night when she was sleeping in the bed with my wife and I and we (me and my daughter) both woke
                    up
                    at
                    the same time in the middle of the night. I saw that the door to our bedroom was wide open and my
                    daughter
                    propped herself up giggled and covered her eyes saying "peekaboo I see you" into the darkness. This
                    would be
                    creepy enough on its own but my daughter was really young and couldnt say very many phrases at the
                    time,
                    and
                    this was the first time she ever said those words. Needless to say it was an uneasy night</p>

                            style="color:rgb(255, 72, 0) ;">Reddit</a>,
                        do you have an eerie garage too? </p>

                    <p>A lot of things went down in this house. But out of all the spooky things they’ve
                        happened to me
                        there,
                        this
                        one just crossed my mind after 18 years.

                        I was 14 years old living in Orange County with my 2 sisters and my mother. We
                        had a rough
                        upbringing so
                        renting an actually house was like a dream come true for us at that time. Until
                        we realized we
                        were
                        living
                        in a haunted house. I was with my mom the day we rented. The garage was scary as
                        hell even in
                        the
                        daylight
                        with people around, it just always gave me a clustered feeling of something
                        being there I
                        couldn’t see.
                        When
                        the garage door was shut it was pitch black, no light at all from outside could
                        get through that
                        garage
                        door.

                        During the summer I would wake up early, I would listen to my cd’s on my radio
                        (so every time I
                        came in
                        or
                        out I made sure my bedroom door was shut because my mom liked to sleep in the
                        living on the
                        couch right
                        outside my bedroom). I would clean my room, the kitchen and bathroom before I
                        would ask my mom
                        if I
                        could
                        meet my best friend at our halfway mark.

                        This particular morning the funky spooky things of the house started early. As I
                        walked out of
                        my
                        bedroom,
                        shut my door walked down the hall passing two bedroom to the restroom I noticed
                        something from
                        the
                        corner of
                        my eye in the kitchen, like a silhouette of a person that vanished (this was
                        normal).<br>

                        My moms bedroom was directly outside the bathroom doorway to the right and it
                        had a private
                        bathroom
                        which
                        lead to the garage. Well as I was walking out the restroom I seen a person
                        walking into my moms
                        bedroom,
                        like a women (which I assumed was my mother since we were the only ones home).
                        Thinking it was
                        my mom I
                        was
                        talking to her about leaving to my friends and the bedroom door shut on my face
                        and I was think
                        “wow
                        she’s
                        rude today”. So I opened the door and again asked if I could go to my friends
                        when her bathroom
                        door
                        started
                        shutting.. when I opened the bathroom door and said “mom!” I realized the garage
                        door was wide
                        open (the
                        garage door was heavy and did not stay open on its own ever) and it was pitch
                        black. In that
                        moment I
                        knew
                        it wasn’t my mom so I ran out, shut her bedroom door behind me started toward my
                        bedroom when I
                        noticed
                        my
                        bedroom door was wide open. I was standing in my room confused and realized my
                        radio was off . I
                        tried
                        turning it in multiple times and seen it was actually unplugged.

                        I went to the living room to wake my mom up and ask if she had went into my room
                        to unplug my
                        radio she
                        said
                        she didn’t ever go into my room or touch my radio that morning because she was
                        sleeping still. I
                        don’t
                        even
                        know why I had to ask if she went into the garage through her bedroom for
                        clarification… but
                        needless to
                        say
                        it wasn’t her either. She asked me t please not leave her there alone, but I did
                        and I feel bad
                        still.
                        Anyways, that night I didn’t want to come back home. I know whatever it was this
                        time, it wanted
                        me in
                        that
                        garage alone.</p>
